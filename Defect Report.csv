Initial System State: 

* System is ON.

* User is logged in with a valid card (e.g., Card 1, PIN 42).

* The initial balance of the Checking account is $100.00

Steps To Reproduce:

# Select Deposit transaction from the main menu.

# Select Checking account.

# Enter a deposit amount of $20.00 (or any valid amount).

# Click the button to simulate inserting the envelope.

# Observe the ""Ending Balance"" printed on the receipt or perform a Balance Inquiry on the Checking account.

Expected Result:

The Checking account balance should increase by exactly the deposited amount.

Actual Result:

The Checking account balance is $10.00 less than the expected total.

* Observed Balance: $110.00 (instead of $120.00).

* The system appears to be deducting a hidden $10.00 fee or miscalculating the total.

* System is prompting for PIN entry.

Steps To Reproduce:

# Enter an *incorrect PIN* (e.g., ""0000"") and press Enter.

# Repeat step 1 two more times (Total of 3 invalid attempts).

# Observe the message stating the card has been retained.

# Click the ""Click to insert card"" button (to start a new session).

# Enter *Card #1* (the same card that was just ""retained"") and press Enter.

# Enter the *correct PIN* (42) and press Enter.

Expected Result:Per Appendix B, the card should be *""permanently retained""*. In the simulation context, entering Card ID ""1"" after it has been retained should result in an error (e.g., ""Card not valid"" or ""Card is currently retained by bank"") or the system should block the login, as the physical card is supposedly inside the machine.

Actual Result:The system accepts Card 1 and the correct PIN, logging the user in successfully. The ""retention"" of the card was only a temporary display message; the system failed to blacklist or lock out the Card ID ""1"" as being held by the bank.
